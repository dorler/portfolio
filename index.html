      <p>Since I didn't read that the project needed to be added to my porfolio until last minute this is my attempt to salvage my grade by attaching it to this page. Since my CSS project was skipped fprmalky i havent had time to complete it. 
          I hope this amuses you and does not impact my team considering we spent the past two weeks on this project.
